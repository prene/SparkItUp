## A community-curated collection of best-practices for Spark. 

If you are an active Spark user, you'll be painfully aware of the pitfalls Spark brings with it. After having used the system for a while, you'll have gathered quite some (implicite) knowledge on how to (not) do things in Spark. In order to help preserve this knowledge, and to kick-start new Spark users, this repository is a place to gather "best-practices" that you as a Spark developer adher to.

In order to decide about noticable best-practices, this repository uses a voting scheme (implemented via [FeatHub](http://www.feathub.com)) to determine whether a suggested best-practice is a best-practice or merely a personal opinion.

After a clear trend in the vote is visible, the owner(s) of this repo will push the best practice suggestions to the spark-it-up.md file.
